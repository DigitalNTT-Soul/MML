Elder God (first God; as opposed to the "old Gods" which refers to all previous Gods) created universe and led angels in weaving of 
the fabric of reality.

Titan was one of those angels.

A few billion years after Creation, Titan is exploring "The Unwoven Regions"(region of the Universe where the fabric of time and space has not been woven, and moves in chaotic fits and spurts) and finds magic.

Excitedly, Titan brings his findings to the Elder God and proposes the idea to release this exciting and beautiful energy into the rest of the universe, to which the Elder God and other angels unanimously agree.

Magic is released throughout the universe.

Humanity (among other races of living creatures) are born throughout the universe, every race with the ability to weave magic.

Humanity discovers their ability to use and manipulate magic, and uses it to fight and kill each other over resources.

Titan, among other angels, is completely horrified by the violence.

Titan comes up with the idea of creating some negative force into the universe to coerce all the different races in the universe to unify.

Other angels and Elder God are hesitant to agree with Titan.

Titan can't wait any longer and, with the aid of eleven other angels, dives deep into The Unwoven Regions to creat the "Wraith Engine"(Catalytic device that turns Depleted Wild Mana into violent wraiths).

Elder God and other angels are just as horrified now as they were when the humans were fighting each other and banish the "Pantheon"(Titan and his eleven followers) into the "Void"(a chasm in the Universal fabric where there is no time, no space, and no escape without outside aid)
