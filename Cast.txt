Silver Wings Magus Academy
	Argentum Flight
		- Highest ranked flight in School, so most of the members are rather popular
		Lazarus Androsin
			- Lazy genius
			- not particularly skilled in combat, unless REALLY pissed
			- has abnormally low mana capacity, so most of his combat requires good strategy
			- has abnormally high mana-formulation speeds, increasing his casting speed dramatically
			- quote <every time he's punched by Cheyenne> "Hey look, the magic pixel *faints*"
			equipment
				Sigma manual (Sorceror)
					advanced spellbook
					looks like a standard spellbook to average mages and non-mages
					advanced mages can read what the spellbook actually says
				Dragon Spine (staff)(Sorceror)
					a 4-foot dried, petrified segment of the compact spinal chord of the previous Sapphire dragon
					crystalline red, with perfect octahedral (think d8 Christian) Sapphires spaced evenly down the shaft
					functions as a mana bank for Lazarus, increasing his mana regeneration rate while he is holding it
					virtually indestructible, but can be broken by a Sapphire dragon
				Tsubasa (conjured katana) (sorceror)
					<Katana trivia: the blade of a katana actually reaches to the bottom of the handle, and is sharp from end to end.>
					Transparent blue unwrapped katana (has no handle; opaque white bandages wrapped around bottom of blade, where handle should be)
					cannot be broken, but otherwise just a normal sword that looks cool.
					
			Sorceror
				time dilation
					can experience time at different speeds, useful in combat, or REALLY boring times
				gravity pulse
					manipulates gravitational energy at any point the mage can visualize
				blink
					teleports one person or thing a short distance
				mass-teleport
					teleports more than one person or thing
					uses exponentially more mana
				mana locker
					summons a dimensional pocket of mana, where he can put objects
					stores all his equipment here, until using it
				mass compression
					makes things smaller or larger
				magnum shell
					a force field with a wide range of adaptability
						can only be centered on the mage
						can cover a rather wide range, but is more powerful in closer ranges
						can block certain people from entering while allowing others through
				crater crush
					forms a crater under the target, and the ground that should have been there wraps around above them, sealing them in
					slowly closes in on the target
				thunder road
					lightning bolt that, once striking a target, will chain through any similar targets within 4 feet of the original target, and continue to do so until it can no longer reach new targets
				gale force
					simple strong wind
				solar scorch
					encases the taret in a complete orb of fire
				torrential wave
					conjures an orb of hyper-compressed water surrounding the target
				glacier blade
					a large spike of ice, to be launched as a javelin
				elemental conjuring
					can create small amounts of different elements
					with enough time to focus, he can actually make objects out of them
			*Spoilers*
		Angiris Bylahal
			- honest, cheerful, and the team mascot, but if you insult someone's dream, he snaps so hard his will causes gale force winds
			- sometimes surprises team with shockingly accurate observations of surroundings, patterns, and reasoning
				- often first to quote Admiral Ackbar ;P
			equipment
				Nightmare Breaker (Cleric)
					
				Aegis of the Blind Sun (Cleric)
					Mythic seal: coats the front of the shield in a red haze of his willpower
						he can project the willpower out of the shield in any form he wants
				Blood-bound Cuirass (Warrior)
					
			Warrior
				White muscle transmutation
				Red Muscle transmutation
				blade bend
					literally alters the blade on his sword
				shock step
					Not exactly a warrior technique, because it only uses willpower to enhance an ability he had already developed
					forms a very unassuming christo-de-redentor pose, falls forward, then dashes at the target at superhuman speeds, with his face literally inches from the ground
			Cleric
				icon: Human Emotion *cough, cough, pearl dragon, cough, cough*
				standard exorcism
				White Hand
					literally creates a floating white hand that can fly up to half a mile, and can do whatever a normal hand can do.
					has a weight/force limit
					can even carry Angiris, therefore allowing him to fly
					can be created in different forms, but marginally easier to control as a hand
				Saint's cloak
					Standard Cleric forcefield
						not as versatile as the Magnum Shell, but stronger defenses in combat
				Mythic Presence
					An extension of White Hand; allows Angiris to create active clones of himself in combat, each capable of casting their own war-trances and miracles (excluding Mythic presence)
					Legendary seal: "Legendary Presence"
					Legendary Presence
						can create dozens of semi-permanent, sovereign, exact copies, yet again, each is capable of casting their own war-trances and miracles (including both Mythic and Legendary Presence)
							semi-permanent because they last forever, or until he dismisses them
							they do not continuously draw on his faith or will-power, and they are each capable of thinking completely for themselves
					Angiris can actively see his lifespan.
						Both Mythic and Legendary presence actively shorten Angiris' lifespan.
							The total number of bodies is the multiplier for how fast his lifespan goes down.
							For instance 1 clone = 2 bodies = consuming 2 seconds of lifespan for every 1 second of time
								     2 clones= 3 bodies = consuming 3 seconds of lifespan for every 1 second of time
								     and so forth
						He does not visibly age from this.

		Samuel Vanekuss
			- <cough, cough> self righteous and pompous jerk <cough, cough>

			equipment

				Soundproof
					causes him to produce no sound, and allows him to hear everything around him in much clearer detail

					bends light around him, rendering him completely invisible
				*Skypierce*
					*cough, cough, epic archery/his only useful team combat skill, cough, cough*

		Headmaster: Precursor, First of Nine
			Archon
				- The first archon, Precursor is the originator of Scripti, although he cannot use it himself
				- he looks like a bunch of bandages wrapped around an invisible human form
					- to Simon, he looks like a large series of 2-dime Scriptis arranged to resemble a human body
				- pick a single second of any multi-layer dubstep and that's pretty much what his voice sounds like
		Vice Principal: Maxwell, yes, THAT Maxwell...
