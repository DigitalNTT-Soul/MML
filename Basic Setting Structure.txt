Magic creatures
	Magic equipment
		equipment engraved with runes, granting magical properties to the weapons
		technically considered Magic creatures, because they use their own mana to power the engraved spells
			Non-mages can use magic equipment effectively because it does not draw from their magical energies and the only brainpower required to control the magic is knowing where to point it, how to activate it, and how to deactivate it
		absorbs wild mana from defeated magic creatures, with no limit
	Wild Mana
		Mana that exists in nature, and does not inhabit humans, spirits, familiars, or magic objects
		all Magic creatures are manifestations of Wild Mana, and defeating one will recharge nearby magic weapons
	*Standard* Dragon
		One dragon of every color born every decade
		20 colors of dragon

			black
			Blue
			Red

			Topaz
			Citrine
			Amethyst
			Onyx
			Pearl
		dragons can be born even if no living dragons exist
		dragons are most powerful *known* magical creatures in existence
		dragon parts make great Magic Equipment because they have intense magical properties that enhance magic abilities
		ALL dragons (especially the Pearl and Onyx Dragons mentioned below) are capable of intelligent thought, communication, diplomacy, emotion, and even magic
	*Pearl Dragon* Graisol
		The embodiment of positive human emotion
		one of the two dragons which can maintain memories from past generations
	Onyx Dragon
		The embodiment of negative human emotion (she is not evil, she just gets stronger when people suffer)
		Graisol's direct sister
		the second of the two dragons which can maintain memories from past generations
	Wraith
		weak enemies
		created almost constantly
			Wraiths are the coagulation of depleted Wild Mana
				forms in roughly an hour, and immediately nearby the location where the spell was cast
			every time a spell is cast, it releases depleted forms of mana into the wild, turning it into depleted Wild Mana
		named based on the type of magic that spawned it (very evident in the appearance of the wraith)
			Elemental - Sorcery
				defeat by using opposing element against it (can only be EFFICIENTLY defeated with magic weapons)
			Zombie - War-trance
				defeat by removing head, limbs, and lower jaw.
			Demons - Miracles
				defeat by standard Cleric Exorcism (exorcisms do not create wraiths)
			Banshee - Hex
				defeated manually by the Shaman's possessing spirit
			Shade - Shadow
				defeat by shining bright lights on it
			Voice - Voxi -- more powerful then other wraiths (but still relatively weak), as voxi generally deplete large quantities of Wild Mana
				defeated ONLY by striking at mach 1 or higher with any attack
			Skeleton - Summoning -- spawns over a hundred if used to resurrect a dead human
				defeat by breaking every bone... takes a while... (any attack that can break bones)
		magic weapons do not summon Wraiths
	Tantrum
		moderately powerful enemy
		they have no recognizable spawning patterns or triggers
			however, many theories exist as to when, why, and how they are created
		have no significant variances in appearance
			not believed to be created by the use of magic
	Enigma
		extrememely powerful, but not nearly as powerful as a dragon
		no recognizable spawning patterns or triggers
		capable of intelligent thought, communication, and even diplomacy
	***Archon***
		***Super uber spoilers from space***
		Precursor, First of Nine
			Archon of Voxi
		????????, Second of Nine
			Father of Faberi

Magic
	-- can use magic freely, but are limited by the abilities of their brains
     	-- brains are only capable of knowing up to two fields of magic
		-- once learning a magic form, there is no way of getting rid of it... you're stuck kiddo...
	-- focusing on a single field allows you to completely master that field, and grants you greater control of it (referred to as Pros, although they may not all be professional in skill)
	-- when mages are particularly emotional, their mana/will/faith/spirit/focus seeps out at an increased rate, and increases the air pressure
	-- all mages have a unique mark on their skin, called a stigma, above any one of the points at which mana is often concentrated
		-- the marks themselves are unique to each mage, although we do not intend to come up with a hundred different freaking marks, so we'll just come up with the marks for the important characters that might get a lot of screen time
		-- the rule for the positioning is not critical to the lore, it's just an excuse to put it in places you'd normally expect to see a magical mark, such as the palm, back of hand, or even the eyes
	-- most forms of magic can create small familiars capable of doing simple errands
		-- can often be used to generate the cute factor

	The Great Star -- the general term to refer to the five common (and legal) classes of magic
		1. Sorceror - Sorcery
			Mana
			manipulation of standard mana
			has many subclasses, and is the most used, and generally the most versatile
				elemental magic
				law magic
					magic that defies the laws of science
				time-space magic (rare, complex, and delicate magic; warning: can break universe; if universe breaks, it will always begin by slowly and painfully eviscerating the Sorceror who cast the problematic spell; universe can be repaired if spell is countered soon enough)

		2. Warrior - War-trance
			Will
			can use willpower to alter or enhance the traits of objects or Warrior
			enhancements slowly sap willpower, but... you know... it's willpower... haven't you ever seen an anime fight before
			they essentially have to be freakin pissed to be any good in a fight, and therefore are *USUALLY* slow to react to traps or surprise attacks
			enhancements and alterations revert to original form when willpower runs out or Warrior dies
				can be used to force certain spells to end, such as hexes that only last until the warrior dies, because as soon as he dies, his self alteration reverts and the last spark of life (remains for around 2 seconds after death) will return
					(he'll have to sleep for... like... a week... and he'll need a whole feast when he wakes up, because he needs to regain his energy)

		3. Cleric - Miracle
			Faith
			Requires prayer to an icon (object, being, or ideal of great value to the Cleric)
				icon must be more important to cleric than cleric's own life
				cannot even generate Faith without having an icon
			strangely enough, the icon can be something very vague, as long as the Cleric values it greatly
			it is common for a cleric to reveal his icon to his allies, although it is not required, and many keep their icons secret
			if the icon is destroyed, the Cleric will fall into a coma for one year and die
				in most cases, re-creating an icon will not save the Cleric
				If the cleric's icon is an ideal, it cannot be destroyed easily, and therefore these clerics have a slight advantage
			icons can actually be other people
				this is an exception to the above recreation rule
				if a human icon is resurrected with summoning magic (illegal) the Cleric will be saved, and usually wakes up within a couple of hours
				if an icon is human, prayers to the icon are not heard by the icon, but the icon can feel a slight tingling at the base of the skull

		4. Shaman - Hex
			spirit
			possessed by a spirit, whom they can call on at any time to perform magic rituals that can only be cast from within the realm of the dead
			can cast curses (hexes) on victims, which last for specified periods of time, or until certain conditions are met
				the spirit, unable to leave the Shaman's body, reaches into the realm of the dead and uses their own power to interfere with the flow of magic energy in the target
				can only have a certain number of curses active at a time, based on the complexity of each individual curse, the skill of the shaman, and the strength of the spirit

		5. Rogue - Shadow
			Focus
			uses brainpower to manipulate energy (but not forms of magic) in the surrounding air
			disadvantaged in live combat, because they have to split their focus between combat and magic
			can bend light and sound, and can completely erase any traces of Rogue's existence (although Rogue still exists; in the context of stealth)
			usually really fast, and skilled with ranged weapons and acrobatics

	Non-star Magics -- only two, voxi and summoning

		Voxan - Voxi
			<no resource/can be used repeatedly with no "charge" or "fatigue">
			Uses special language to bend Wild Mana to the caster's will
			complete mastery is required to use it safely
			learning is illegal, because previous maxi-magus was killed with it, and mages are VERY paranoid ("guns kill people" logic)
			all mages who knew voxan magic before it became illegal maintain their freedom, but will be hunted if they teach or openly use it
			
		Summoner - summoning
			uses magic objects and biological material to turn dead flesh into magic familiars, or to resurrect the dead
			illegal due to connection to necromancy and the relentlessness of the resulting wraiths
			
		***Sky-Scribe - scripti***
			***super uber spoilers from space***
			mana pearl
				- coagulations of mana within the bloodstream, creating mana dense enough to be seen as a mist when pushed from the body.
			0-dime
				- just point and think
				- about as powerful as a firecracker. Usually used as a distraction
			1-dime
				- a linear scripti; snap finger to cast
				- not very useful in combat. Can perform simple acts such as unlocking doors and sending messages
			2-dime
				- a circular scripti, center symbol must be struck with extreme force to cast.
				- main combat spells. Resource-cheap and effective in normal combat.
			3-dime
				- a spherical, expanding scripti, thrown at the target with any means; expands and activates on contact
				- Superior combat spells. Resource-demanding and hyper-effective. Boss fight spells
			4-dime
				- form a 2-dime scripti in front of the Sky-Scribe, and punch it from both sides simultaneously, making it "flush" both arms with hyperactive mana pearls
				- very dangerous for the Sky-Scribe's health
				- spellcasting alterations
					- ALL mana pearls expelled from the body at will
					- formulation is completely instant, and requires absolutely no movement or gestures
					- firing is instant, requires only minimal gestures, and is automatically at maximum power
				- striking someone while using 4-dime leaches the target's mana and compresses it into mana pearls for the Sky-Scribe
				- turns arms black with electric-blue circuitry-looking lines going from shoulder to hand; just for the cools, it doesn't damage clothing, but the sleeves disappear while active
Non-magic -- can still use simple magic and magic equipment, but their brains are not capable of processing complex or large spells

	Monk
		can absorb all magic resources from mages or magic objects by touching them (at will, so mages don't have to worry about giving a monk a high-five)
			have large mana capacity
			can transfer magic energies to other mages by touching them
			the combination of the above two abilities make Monks a vital component of teams expecting to be engaged in long-term combat
		Must move fast and have training in martial arts, as well as study magic theory
		generally peacekeepers
		often assigned to professional mage teams, if not a peacekeeper

	Militia
		Humans specializing in the use of magic equipment

	citizen
		standard civilian, usually capable of the most standard sorceries, but other fields of weak magic are GENERALLY out of their reach
Universe
	It's pretty much modern Earth, minus terrorism, plus magic
	EVERYONE already knows about the existence of Magic (yes, I'm aware I just disabled a valuable plot tool, sorry.)
	There is VERY little bad blood between Mages and Non-Mages
		There are SOME power-hungry mages who think mages should rule over all non-mages
		there are SOME non-mages who think they're already under the mages' control and want to rebel
		laws surrounding the actions of mages are strict
			duels
				duels are usually large events with big crowds
				duel participants don't die in combat
				mages may duel each other in registered arenas
					any magical combat outside an arena is considered militant, and will be dealt with harshly.
				mages may not duel non-mages unless the non-mage challenges the mage with multiple witnesses
					
	There are roughly as many successful non-mages as there are successful mages
	Mage academies are very similar to modern high schools, and the portion of the brain that produces and controls magical energies *USUALLY* only begins to develop at puberty, so don't worry about little elementary-schoolers burning each other to death

Spellcasting walkthrough
	casting split up into three steps
		1. magic energy is useless while housed in the body, so the mage must push it out of the body in order to use it
		2. magic energy must be arranged in specific patterns to prepare the effects of the spell or ability
		3. magic energy pattern must be activated, or "fired" in order to activate the effect
	steps shortened to
		1. push
		2. mold
		3. fire
	the timeline of casting spells *usually* involves
		1 part pushing
		2 parts forming
		1 part firing
		
		i.e. a 4-second cast time usually takes
			1 second to push the mana
			2 seconds to form it
			1 second to fire it
