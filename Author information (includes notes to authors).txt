Notes to cast:
	With this being an anime, there are a lot of visuals that need to be decided on. I personally would like all cast members to participate in the artwork in some small way, whether it be creating designs or simply helping us select which artwork to use, in cases where we have multiple pieces that could fit a situation.
	We can have multiple artists in each category, and each artist can participate in multiple categories, but the following are the confirmed categories (ALL cast members and other artists can participate in artwork selection):
		Character art:
		Object art:
			Dylan Ruppell
			Christian Fox
		Spell animation art:
			Dylan Ruppell

		Artwork Selection:
			Christian Fox
			Dylan Ruppell
