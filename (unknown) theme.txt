<>I don't know if this will be the opening or closing theme... they have to be different...<>


Many souls go to die
	when you're standing there frozen in fear.
There are cries only heard by those,
	who would show their own tears.
There are battlecries
	coming from behind
	wounded eyes
*unfinished*



<>Ending theme for last season<>
He who dies with the biggest heart
	wins
He who survives must not turn to
	sin
In the memory
	of
	your
	friend
You must fight the battle that
	ne~ver~e~ends

*unfinished*

<>Destination: Unknown<>
Can you hear the angels cry
As they're falling from the sky
*crowd* Save that man. Save that man.

Hear the legions of the air,
Shout out in despair
*crowd* Save that man. Save that man.

*softly*
but their cries fall short,
And the hero dies once again
No heartbeat; no life support
in the end, in the end

*Loud and proud*
No one should have to know,
that pain of letting go
again~~~~~~~
again~~~~~~~

take everything you feel,
that makes this life so surreal,
*softly*
to the end...
to the end...

*pause*

*softly*
When your dreams are shattered,
and your friends lie battered
	and cold.
*dramatic violin*

When your dreams are shattered,
and your friends lie battered
	and cold
*more dramatic violins*

*singer + crowd*
When your dreams are shattered,
and your friends lie battered
	and cold
*whole orchestra of dramatic violins*

*singer + crowd + loud bass drum*
When your dreams are shattered,
and your friends lie battered
	and cold
*1 dramatic violin, breaking loop*

*low, rumbling tension*
surrounded by the armies of hell,
as the Prince of heaven dies.
the emotions in your heart spell,
the end of the Lord of lies

For you will fight, and he will fall
the end has been predicted.
So show the world, once and for all,
your powers, unrestricted!

can you hear the souls **cry out**
as the enemies **pry out**
     the jewels of our existence

you have never felt **so wronged**
by the timeless words: **carry on**
     No prize for your persistence

*softly*
can you feel the fighting fade
as you slip into the shade
    a body so disfigured

<unfinished:: still need conclusion>
