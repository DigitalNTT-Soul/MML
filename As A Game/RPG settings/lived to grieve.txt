You've lived to love
You've lived to grieve
You've lived and now
you have to leave
and all that's left 
are memories
of your face

You've lived to cry
you've lived to scream
at all the things
you'll never be
you hear their voices
whispering
"it's ok"

They spilled her blood
They loosed your rage
Let slip the lion
from its cage
