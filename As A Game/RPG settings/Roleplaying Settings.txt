#The Skill system#
##################
	All skills are split between Spells and Abilities
		A spell is any skill that directly involves magic
		An ability is any skill that does not directly involve magic
	Players can use multiple SKILLS per turn, based on their Dexterity rating
	Players can only use a set number of SPELLS per combat encounter, determined by their Intelligence rating
	Abilities are limitless, and are limited only by the number of times you use them per turn.
	Each SKILL has a Mastery Rating attached to it
	Using a Skill in any context generates "Experience", varying based on the context
		Basic use: 1 xp
		Combat use: 5 xp*
		Training/Study: ?? xp**
		*Combat use refers to any context in which your character senses danger, such as
			combat
			stealth
			other intense activity
		**The amount of xp generated by the Training/Study use of a Skill is randomized by a d6
			1:   -5 xp signifying an incredibly inaccurate or confusing observation, decreasing your overall understanding of the skill (cannot decrease experience below the threshold of the current Mastery Rating)
			2:    5 xp signifying a study session in which you discovered very little about how the skill works
			3-5: 10 xp signifying a reasonably valuable observation
			6:   20 xp signifying magnificent discovery
			Certain skills are easier or harder to understand, increasing or decreasing the result of the study roll accordingly, to a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 6
	Once a predetermined amount of Experience is collected, the character reaches a "Breakthrough", which increases the Mastery Rating of that skill by 1.
	The Mastery Rating of a spell determines the power of the skill and how creative you can be with the skill

#The Rank system#

	upon reaching certain thresholds of Overall Mastery Rating (The sum of the Mastery Ratings of every known spell), the characters will be eligible to take an advancement examination
		Advancement examinations are separate scenarios in which the player must achieve a certain objective within a reasonable amount of time
		Players cannot be critically wounded during advancement examinations
		Upon passing an exam, the player is then promoted to the next Magic Association rank, granting the associated rank reward
		Upon failing an exam, the player is then required to wait a month in order to attempt again
