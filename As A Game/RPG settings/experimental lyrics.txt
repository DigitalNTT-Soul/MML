If you measure the weight of the hate
that's held against me you will see
The amount I hate myself versus
the amount the world hate me

It's about the same as the ratio
of size between the sun and earth
The only thing I've yet to ask is
"What the fuck's it worth?"

This life you hold so dearly
this world you love so deeply
This agony inside of us,
that swallows me completely.

This passion burning,
hotter and hotter,
that rips apart the soul

In this one-night play
with no rehearsal
What the fuck's my role?!

What will we find,
digging deeper
into the unknown

Now that you can,
understand me,
my Rage can now be shown1

In your dreams,
can you hear your own screams?
Do you cheers at the steam,
spitting off of
	the rage inside your soul

Go home!
It matters not, who you know
Or who has lost the road,
cause you're in control
	of your own fate.
