1. Character words must be in "quotes"
2. Whispers to other characters must be in (parentheses)
3. Character Actions must be in some form of formatted flavor text ***___like this___***.
4. Voice chat can only be used for explanations. Nothing said in voice chat can or will be taken as a character action or character statement. All actions and dialogue is text.
5. New players mute ALL channels excluding Rules, General, series-development, timestamp, and iron_armies_magus_academy
6. DO NOT spam ANY @mention tag. You may use each @mention tag once per 20 minutes.
7. General chat is for meta-gaming and random bantering. Nothing said in general chat is actually revealed to the characters.
8. Fighting amongst players is forbidden. Fighting amongst characters is stupid, but encouraged :P.
9. Since DM is pretty much the only person who understands the entirety of the backstory of this universe and campaign, what DM says is Fact, Law, and usually about 100x as reliable as what you or the other players are saying.
10. In all cases where the DM and player's undersatnding of the situation differ to a level that significantly effects combat or plot results, the result is determined by a #!flip.
EE. Everything else is just common sense. If you're an ass, the campaign will fuck you. That simple.
